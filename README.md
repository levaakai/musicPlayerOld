Project's Title
BoomBox v2

Project Description
The BoomBox is a web-based audio player that allow users to be able to play audio files that are on their local devices. Vanilla Javascript was used in the implementation of this project because, shortly after being introduced to JS, I wanted to build something that would help test my skillset and due to that, I used JS.
 
A major challenge faced in this project was working with files (reading files from the local machine and manipulating it). This challenge proved a great disadvantage to my making of this project. Though I found a way to work around it for now, I look forward to finding a much more succint and efficient way to tackle this challenge.
 
 
Using BoomBox
* The head document for the app is the "index.html" file. Opening this file in the browser should launch BoomBox.
* To load audio the files, the big blue "Browse" button can be clicked on to open your local directories, from which you can select the files you want.
* Once audio files are selected, user can proceed to press the play button to start playing the audio files.
* The 'next', 'prev' and 'pause' buttons do exactly what their names suggest.
